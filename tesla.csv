[Goldman predictions on Tesla opening charging access](https://preview.redd.it/de9rhgtbfkma1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=44fe69f69c041e5885755b1194cb958496b583dc)

The analysis by Goldman Sachs showed that Tesla's revenue could increase by billions of dollars. This is because Tesla's charging network is already the most extensive and reliable in the world, and opening it up to other EVs will make it an even more attractive option for EV drivers. It's worth noting that the Goldman Sachs analysis only used a quantity of chargers that was below the current number of Tesla chargers. This means that the revenue potential could be even higher than estimated, as Tesla continues to expand its charging network.

By opening up its charging network to all EVs, Tesla is not only creating a new revenue stream but directly interacting with their competitor’s customers, as they have to download the Tesla App and pay a membership fee. This could encourage non-Tesla EV owners to switch to a Tesla vehicle, which could further increase Tesla's market share in the EV industry. 

One of the biggest selling points of Tesla's charging network is the fact that it is about 25% cheaper per session than other EV charging networks. While the idea of paying a $12.99 monthly fee may seem costly at first, this price point is still feasible for the entire EV market. This could make Tesla's charging network the go-to charging solution for all EV drivers, not just Tesla owners.

Moreover, with the rollout of this technology, Tesla can tap into billions in federal subsidies, further increasing their revenue potential.

(And why it won't, yet.)",43,11e0ynj,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/11e0ynj/how_tesla_could_produce_a_car_that_costs_369/,31,"Like many (most?) of us, I believe that Investor Day will include an announcement of an inexpensive compact car.

I see happening for a few reasons:

1. I believe that demand is starting to fade a bit more than was expected with the federal tax credit.

2. This is the shortest path to 20 million cars by 2030.

3. This in preparation for RoboTaxi, acquiring more data for FSD, and with the goal of using pre-owned cars in that RoboTaxi network.

Next, the costs to build:

Musk said that the Model 2 would cost approximately half of the cost of the current line of cars. The current cost is about $38,000 [Source](https://ir.tesla.com/#quarterly-disclosure) .

That would put the costs on the order of $19,000. (I think this is low.)

I also think this is part of the reason for the announcements of Tesla planning on acquiring lithium mines. They are hoping to reduce their costs. This may also the reason they may be looking to open a gigafactory in Mexico.

Next, the sale price:

On Battery Day, Tesla ""pre-announced"" a compact car with a price of $25,000. Adjusted for inflation, that puts the price at about $28,700.

Factoring in the EV tax credit, that reduces the price to $21,200.

The profit on the car for Tesla would be 34%. That's why I'd estimate the cost of production will likely be higher than $19,000. I would guess it would be around $23,000. (Though I will explain why it might end up being closer to $19,000 later.) That still puts the profit at about 25%.

Now, the costs to lease:

**Toyota Camry**

Lease price of [$482](https://www.buyatoyota.com/westernwashington/payment-estimator/?series=camry&year=2023&zip=90210&offer=camry_apr_f5c60269-671d-4ade-969e-d068b30ef9bc)

Fuel costs of $77 (800 mi/mo * (3.365$/gal.) / (35 mi/gal))

Oil costs of $8.50 (800 mi/mo * ( [$32](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-cost-oil-change-2023/) /oil change) / (3000mi/oil change)

That gives us a total of $567.50

**""Model 2""**

Lease cost of [$331](https://www.calculator.net/auto-lease-calculator.html?cloanamount=21200&cmonthlypay=380&cloanterm=36&cratetype=interestrate&cinterestrate=6&cdownpayment=0&ctradeinvalue=0&csaletax=0&cresidualvalue=12296&printit=0&ctype=standard&x=76&y=23)

*This assumes a valuation of 58% after 3 years. I believe this is VERY, VERY conservative, as the Model 3 has an assumed depreciation of 32%. However, I wasn't willing to give a compact car this low of a depreciation.*

*I honestly think that this lease price is WAY too high. Literally maybe $100 too high, but I wasn't willing to go less yet. 6% interest rate is too high, and 42% depreciation is too high. But I just can't bring myself to go under $300. Factor this in as you might.*

Energy cost of $27 (800 mi/mo * [$0.168](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm) /kWh / 5 kWh/mi) 

Total cost would be $358.

This would save you $209.50, or 36.9% off the price of a Camry.

------------------

**Okay, now speculation time**

Okay, now, if you're Tesla, you're about to have a problem: You are going to announce a vehicle that will be a LOT cheaper than your current cars. And it might kill your current demand. Why would someone buy a Model 3 or Model Y now, when they can wait a few years, and get a Model 2 for so much less? After federal tax credits, it would literally be HALF the purchase price of a cheap Model 3.

And so, you risk hitting the [Osborne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect), where people won't buy your current product when they expect your new one to be cheaper and/or better.

And let's be honest, the Model Y is almost as good as the Model X. And the Model 3 is almost as good as the Model S. It stands to reason that the Model 2 will be almost as good as the Model 3.

And because of this, Tesla might want to do two things:

1. Make the Model 2 production far away. 2025-2026 is a good time frame to announce full production. Sure, it won't actually come out until 2027, but people will start saving, and put off buying their budget cars. (It is important to note that people putting off buying budget cars doesn't hurt Tesla because Tesla doesn't sell a budget car. It will hurt budget car manufacturers.)

2. Make the Model 2 a clearly inferior car. I would cap the Model 2 at 250+ miles range for the base. Make it a 55 kWh (50kWh usable) battery pack. (I would be almost tempted to go lower, and go to 45kWh usable, but I think you might be able to still squeeze out 250+ miles of range.) Additionally, I think you are going to want to reduce the size (and therefore weight and cost) of the motor. The Model 3 has 271 horsepower at its base. The motor weighs about 210 pounds. I don't think a Model 2 needs more than 150 horsepower. That drops weigh and cost, just like reducing battery sizes. The Model 3 weighs in at 3600 lbs. I think the Model 2 would be somewhere closer to 3000 lbs. This would give the Model 2 a 0-60 time very similar to a modern Camry. 

*By making a smaller battery pack, using a smaller engine, and making it an inferior car, you could reduce the cost back closer to $19,000.*

**However, the Model 2 is going to have a TON of benefits, especially for Tesla.**

First off, it allows Tesla to use less batteries. That is the most limiting factor. They are still battery constrained. And probably will be for the remainder of the decade.

Next, it will allow for more sales of FSD. I believe that FSD will be Tesla's largest profit source. Be it as a service ($250/mo) or purchased ($15,000). The more chances you have to sell FSD, the more profit you have.

With those greater sales of FSD, you get more data, making FSD better. Additionally, it allows faster updating of traffic conditions and changes in the road. If you have 5 vehicles pass down a road in a day, each one will be able to feed information to the next about how to better handle that specific location.

Next, the used Model 2's could be flipped into RoboTaxis. Tesla gets the data, and then, when the leases run out (or when the buyer sells the car back to Tesla), the car is reconditioned, and sent out as a RoboTaxi. After FSD, this is likely to be Tesla's next biggest profit source, and perhaps would supplant FSD in the 2030s.

------------------------------------

However, none of this is going to happen quickly. They need to build a series of factories. They need a lot of lithium. And they don't want to go too fast. To be honest, they might be better off decreasing the price of the Model 3 and Y first. But even announcing the Model 2 might hurt Toyota and Honda even more than Tesla, since they are the ones selling $28,000 cars. Why buy a Toyota or Honda when you can get a Tesla in 2-4 years? And why wait for a Model 2 when a Model 3 can be leased right now for $349 (with $4500 down)?

You really wanna mess with Toyota and Honda? If you put down a $100 deposit now, Tesla can promise you that you will be guaranteed a $249 lease when cars start coming out. Or, for that same deposit, you can get a $399/mo payment for a 60 month loan.",1677573112.0
