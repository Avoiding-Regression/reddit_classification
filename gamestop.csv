This thread will serve as a megathread for all customer questions. Anyone who continues to spam questions not in the megathread will get 3 day bans. We all know you're frustrated, but your answer is probably in this thread or in of the previous guest question megathreads.  Searching these threads will also probably give you answer faster than making your own.

Below is a short FAQ. Feel free to ask more questions in this thread, or search this thread/the old megathread.

\-------------------**Customer Question FAQ--------------------------**

**WHATS GOING ON WITH THE $5 MONTHLY PRO COUPON?**

Currently it is working on digital and physical items, only in store.  Digital purchases do not exist anymore below $10 as of January 2023 for coupon redemption.

**Where's the weekly ad?**

It doesn't exist anymore.

**I can't find a trade value for a game?**

Some games do not have trade values listed on the website. It is what it is. Call your local store.

**Can I trade stuff in?**

Yes. However, you may be restricted to trade credit only. Only select items can be sold for cash, and some stores may not be able to give cash at all.

**How can I return a broken product/warranty exchange/wrong product/etc?**

If it was purchased in store, take it to a store with the receipt.  If it was an online purchase call customer service ONLY(Do NOT email or think chat support will ever return).

**What happens to my preorder money if I don't pick the game up?**

The money will always be there. You can cancel and get your money back. However, 30 days after release, you can only get in store credit back.

**Can I cancel my preorder/switch it to digital over the phone?**

No. In store preorders can only be cancelled/changed in person.

**When will stores restock -insert item here-?**

No one on this subreddit will have any way to answer that question. Employees don't know when stuff is coming in until it's already in transit. They don't control when they get product.

**Power up rewards coupons won't redeem/activate?**

Try the website. The app has been broken.  If still an issue you have to CALL customer service or wait and try again later(Yes, it may take months to get fixed)

**Gamestop's website is blocking me?**

We've been getting this report several times. We don't have any way to know how to fix that. Obviously try the normal things like clearing your cookies, try a different browser, turn off your VPN etc. If that doesn't fix it, you could try calling customer service.

**My preorder isn't showing in the app/website?**

This has been removed for all in store preorders.  Online preorders are frequently slow to update, do not rely on this.  

**Why isn't customer service answering the phone?**

They're short staffed like everything at Gamestop because they won't spend money.  Wait times will be hours.  Yes, you have to call and wait until you get someone, no we can't do anything here about it.

**Why can't I buy PSN/XBL/Eshop/Steam etc.?**

Multiple purchases can trigger fraud prevention that will block until reviewed.  Nobody knows the period, it could be a few days, it could be months.

**Where is my digital content purchase?**

Purchases are not immediate.  Just because a previous one was doesn't mean they always are.  They can(and often do) take up to 72 hours(weekday only) to fulfill.  If you order on a weekend, be prepared for a wait fairly often.",1677992470.0

4,An interaction:,10,11orlsv,GameStop,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/11orlsv/an_interaction/,18,"A man with a wife and two children comes up to my counter. I greet them and ask how I can help them today. They mumble, looking at each other, and I catch ‚Äúswitch‚Ä¶.headphones‚Ä¶.price‚Äù. I respectfully say ‚ÄúSorry, sir, but I‚Äôm confused. You want to purchase the Nintendo switch headphones?‚Äù And they said ‚Äúyes‚Äù, and they lead me to them. We get the transaction going and he gives me his phone number with his account. I ask ‚Äúare these for your young children or you and your companion?‚Äù He says ‚Äúthey‚Äôre for my children.‚Äù I said ‚Äúthen I would highly suggest attaching our warrant-‚Äú he cuts me off and says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù with a smile. Not wanting to come off as confrontational, I just say ‚Äúokay‚Äù and go to the checkout screen. Unprompted, he adds ‚Äúeven though they‚Äôre their fourth pairs.‚Äù I let out a bit of an exasperated ‚Äúokay‚Äù and shrug. He says ‚Äúthey make their own money, they lose their own money.‚Äù Again, I didn‚Äôt need him to elaborate. I just checked him out and let him leave. In my opinion, if you offer your reasoning behind a decision instead of just stating your decision, you‚Äôre leaving it more open to scrutiny. So if by some reason anyone reading has the same views on warranties for children, here‚Äôs my 2 cents. You‚Äôre still letting them spend and waste YOUR money that you gave them. You‚Äôre not teaching them the value of their items by both allowing them to waste it on a fresh pair, and by refusing to explain to them what a warranty is. You think you‚Äôre setting them up to learn the value of money and the consequences of wasting it, but obviously this isn‚Äôt working since your children have already been through 3 pairs and their behavior hasn‚Äôt changed. That is all. Feel free to give your opinion in the comments.",1678560228.0

There was a three month (ish) period during this time that I left and did a different job. Upon coming back, we got a new ASL. Said ASL was a regular customer turned employee‚Äì Great. The ASL was a great salesman and often got shit done as it needed to. However, a coworker and I eventually started working with him more and hearing more bullshit. It basically all boils down to **bigotry**, but I'll give some examples. In front of me, he mocked a disabled **CHILD** we had for a customer, making fun of how he spoke and how ""parents with disabled children will do anything to make them happy"". He was very explicit in saying that disabled people ""do nothing for society"". ASL also loved to say the **R slur**, calling people that and situations that as well. ASL also had a blatant disregard for the LGBTQ+ community, calling them names and always having something negative to say about them, glaring at our LGBTQ+ customers or flat out ignoring them, stating he ""understands JK Rowling"", and using the **F slur** as well.There is more to his behavior, but I digress. 

I stood up for a coworker who was being singled out and getting absolutely 0 hours, despite his seniority. This singling out was happening to me too as the only female working at the store, but I chose to stand up for my coworker and not myself. This was an issue for ASL. Next day, ASL comes in to take over my shift. He explains how me standing up for the coworker was unnecessary and rude. I had my back turned to him, not wanting to engage in this. He said ""Can you face me when I'm speaking to you?"". He asked me what my problem was with him to which I simply said, ""I just don't like you."" He didn't like this obviously. I basically explained how his beliefs disgust me and I can't like someone like that, even though I was always cordial and professional to him regardless of my feelings. He raises his voice by this point, calling me belligerent, disrespectful, childish, etc etc, stating that the world doesn't revolve around me and my opinions. I clocked out, backed away and gave him my keys, telling him that I am done. He continued to belittle me with the words I listed already, to which I told him I hope his child ends up to think differently. 

Called DM immediately. She said I can wait to return to work until SL gets back from leave and that she will find me shifts within the area in the meantime if possible. I was also told this would be taken to HR. That was about two weeks ago. During that two weeks, I was informed that ASL was making stuff up, twisting the story, and all that good stuff which I 100% expected. Two days ago, she called me to say that ASL was spoken to and that he will change his behavior. **THAT'S ALL THAT WAS DONE.** I was also told that I was speaking ""inappropriately"" in the first place. I told her that this isn't worth fighting for and that he would probably just punish me. I told her I'm officially done with the company. 

Posting this was my last resort to bring attention to this side of things. *Corporate isn't the only problematic part of working for Gamestop.* I'm just at a loss over this. I've been told to call HR myself, but would that even help???",1678305675.0

It was the absolute worst job I ever had for several reasons.

I got the job in June of last year, and by October, I was fired. I have ADHD and my manager was FULLY AWARE of it when I got the job. I was only scheduled to work two hours per week, yes TWO HOURS PER WEEK, due to my availability being so low when I got the job. In September, I went back to a local community college. I held the position of GA (guest advisor), but quickly realized that they needed to take the ""Now Hiring"" sign off the door.

During my time working there, we lost 7 employees, 5 of whom got fired by the stupid manager. My manager had the worst anger problems I'd ever seen in my life. He'd just randomly start screaming at me and criticizing me in the most atomic way possible. He always came in reeking of weed and would even smoke it while on the clock. When I would work, he treated that time like it was his time to do whatever he wanted, and he did whatever he wanted, some things cannot be spoken of.

The worst was when I asked for more hours. I was not driving myself at the time and needed money to pay for my road test and a car, but my paychecks were $80 at most. How does a college kid live on a paycheck that averages $30 after taxes?

But the day I was fired was the worst. I always would call to see if I had to work, and by this point, I hadn't worked in over a month. So I went to the store and the door was locked, but one of the other GAs was there and the manager went to the store and told me to ""leave the f---ing store because I wasn't on the schedule that week."" So I did. I came back because my ride was waiting and I needed to look for a capture card, but the manager was not the one who fired me. It was a GA that was LEFT ALONE IN THE STORE!!!!

The manager always would bring his kids in with him and I told the kids to leave me alone, and they never did because the manager was doing something in the back. He gave his cell phone number to everyone who worked in the store except me, and eventually, I asked for it, but he changed it and never gave me his new number. When I called him to ask what the deal was, he didn't even answer the question. He danced around it like I was stupid. He also had an issue with me playing PS2 games over newer games. I can barely afford to buy the latest NBA 2K release every year let alone a PS5. 

I will never buy anything from or enter a ShameStop ever again because of the experience I had working there.",1678400116.0

I miss my DL because every single time I called them for a stupid question, they were always happy to answer it, even if I had already asked before. 

I miss my DL because when my partner had alcohol poisoning, and I called them to tell them I wasn‚Äôt going to open tomorrow, they walked me through the whole traumatic experience and helped me get my partner the help they needed. 

I miss my DL because they would always offer to take me to the bakery next door on visits and get our entire store snacks and drinks to get us through the holiday rush. 

I miss my DL because they understood stores at, well, the store level since they had been a GA, SGA, ASL, and SL throughout their career. 

I miss my DL because corporate thought that they were more ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù than ‚Äúfor the company,‚Äù and decided to terminate them from the company.

Me and my SL are good friends, and were killing it in an area that didn't tend to do so well. Went on like a 6 week run of 5/6 or 6/6 on metrics. Seasonal time, while rough, I still enjoyed it.

And then came SL2.

I remember the first two stores in my area they SL2'd, we both barely got out of the crossfire. He nearly got the store, and I nearly got moved to being the new SL2's ASL. Thank god for shitty American car-based infrastructure for stopping that.

But you can't outrun SL2 forever. And eventually, it got to us in October of last year. We were being given a complete dump, completely destaffed, and with several thousand dollars in shrink from a former employee. (Thanks LP, truly ""see everything.""üñï)

It was hard, and so much of my joy for working here was gone. But hey, I was still making money, and that's what I needed. And GameStop, despite the downsides, is an easy job.

Holiday pushed me this time.

An ASL, underpaid to run a store, being forced to run nearly 45 hours at least two weeks. It was the most stress I've been under in a long time. Don't think I went home and saw my family for almost a week. Always getting back too late for that. Got given a GameStop gift card for Christmas, literally burst out in tears and went to go have a panic attack.

Could say I was a little stressed.

But I figured it'd get better. But I should have known, it never gets better here. Less than a week after Christmas Eve, massive hour cuts. Kissed all my seasonals goodbye on the 27th. But there's rumors of a district redraw, let's play the lottery. Never know!

I didn't know how good we'd had it. Went from an annoying, albeit well intentioned and at least somewhat in touch DM, to a complete imbecile who can't ground himself in what it's like for the little guy out here anymore. He's been higher up for so long, he can't remember what it's like to have no coverage, and have no product, and have crackheads in every day trying to steal stuff.

And once inventory came, and he got all up my ass because one of my employees had one, yes ONE SINGULAR Funko Pop in a drawer until payday, that was it. That was finally it. I called my SL in tears, told him this isn't going to work anymore. We never work together, our second store sucks purely from a building perspective, and I hated every aspect of the job.

The dickhead DM. The 10 metrics, where they know you'll never get them. The mounting amount of theft and gunpoint robberies because people know we're single coverage. It's not worth $13.

So I've put in my two weeks, and I haven't been happier in months. This company has done nothing but shit on me for the last two years, and I'm glad it's sinking like the titanic. Only hope it goes faster.

Just needed to get that out. Peace. ‚úåÔ∏è",1678223603.0

42,I asked AI (chatGPT) to write an essay on why GS is a horrible company. It didn‚Äôt disappoint..,27,11l94xn,GameStop,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/11l94xn/i_asked_ai_chatgpt_to_write_an_essay_on_why_gs_is/,8,"GameStop is a retail corporation that specializes in selling video games, consoles, and accessories. While it has been a popular destination for gamers for years, there are several reasons why it can be considered a horrible company. From their poor treatment of employees to their questionable business practices, GameStop has shown time and time again that they are not a company that values their customers or staff.

One of the biggest reasons why GameStop is a horrible company is the way they treat their employees. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of GameStop employees being forced to work long hours with no overtime pay. Many employees have also reported being subjected to verbal abuse from their managers and having to deal with hostile customers on a daily basis. Additionally, GameStop has a history of laying off large numbers of employees without warning or severance pay, making it difficult for these workers to support themselves and their families.

Another reason why GameStop is a horrible company is their business practices. One of the most controversial practices is their trade-in program, which has been criticized for offering customers far less money for their used games and consoles than they are actually worth. In many cases, customers have reported receiving just a fraction of what their games are worth, leaving them feeling cheated and frustrated. Additionally, GameStop has been accused of selling used games as new and pushing customers to buy unnecessary add-ons and warranties.

GameStop has also been accused of contributing to the decline of the video game industry. With the rise of digital downloads and online retailers, GameStop's business model has become increasingly outdated. Rather than adapting to the changing market, GameStop has doubled down on their physical stores, leading to declining profits and store closures. This has had a negative impact on the industry as a whole, as many smaller game developers and publishers rely on physical retailers like GameStop to sell their products.

Finally, GameStop has a reputation for being unfriendly to its customers. Many gamers have reported feeling unwelcome or uncomfortable in GameStop stores, due in part to the company's pushy sales tactics and focus on pre-orders and add-ons. Additionally, GameStop has been accused of inflating the prices of its products and engaging in anti-competitive practices.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why GameStop can be considered a horrible company. From their mistreatment of employees to their questionable business practices and unfriendly customer service, GameStop has repeatedly shown that they are not a company that values their customers or staff. While they may have been a popular destination for gamers in the past, it is clear that they are not a company that deserves our support or patronage.",1678218309.0

Anyway, me and the other employees at our store had brought up concerns with our new DL this past week.

Anyway, this week, we pointed out to the SL2 how they continued to do the things we brought up to the DM.

56,peace out,26,11jtcma,GameStop,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/11jtcma/peace_out/,5,"It's been real.. unfortunately I've come to realize I can't stay at a place where I am 10000% unappreciated. Been with the company since 2009 with a number of different titles but mostly as an asl and was fully capable of running a store and had taken temporary positions where I would see fit for my own life and balancing. I have turned down multiple sl offers throughout the years because I could definitely understand why staff would end up hating their jobs and having nothing but negativity coming in everyday I wanted to stay comfortable with what I was and that led into years of loving my job even if that meant being SEVERLY UNDERPAID, I just never tested the waters to notice because I was happy in my position and stability. 

To corporate:¬† you have sucked the life out of wanting this to be a cool and fun place¬† and in turn that rubs off on my new and my loyal guests. I feel like I'm being pushed out to lead to new staff coming in that doesn't know that the recent changes are also changing the view on its job itself. I'd love to be able to chit chat with the guy that regularly comes in that talks and shows me videos on his phone of a 2012 video of a saints row he's having a hard time beating, but I have redundant tasks and pictures to take of nonsense of.
That new sga that was hired and pretty much had to be thrown to the wolves because there's not enough time to be properly trained doesn't know any better and this is new gamestop they will be accustomed to. They don't know that there was triple coverage and that people would laugh and be excited about work and having to train a rookie. They don't know that 30 boxes of shipment would come in with a backroom register and 2 other people would be able to show them the ropes. To them it's completely normal to be alone and at the register with a guest, answering the phone and then shuffling to the backroom to let the boxes be dumped off for when you're able to properly process the shipments coming from TWO different carriers. It will be the new normal that you dont have the appropriate time to actually gain relationships with the guest you will only have the time to be a robot at the register with the 7 different add ons to suggest and frantically do the tasks while no one is standing right in front of you or on the phone. It can be done, I'm not saying it can't. After my years with the company I've grown accustomed to multitasking like you wouldnt believe. But there goes the enjoyable parts of the job with it and I have first hand experienced how quickly it will drain anything you are looking forward to for the day. Where is the incentive to want to do well at your job? I always loved that anyone from the higher up chain could stop in and say this store is clean and nice.. the staff is doing what they are supposed to we do not need to come in an worry about this staff/store. My old dm once said ""this store is a well oiled machine"" and the only reason that has changed is because of the company treating us at the store level differently than the past. 


Anyone feeling like they are being treated unfairly, you are. Anyone feeling like there's too much stress, there is. Anyone feeling like they can't keep up with the expectations, it really is too much. There's literally anything else that will not drain your daily confidence the way that gamestop corporate does. I'm lucky to find something else in a different field that pays better and is so much less stressful, and I wouldn't have known if I didn't start looking and applying at other places. 

So long gamestop. If you want more loyal employees treat the new generations better. I fully and 100% would've stayed if I felt like I was appreciated. I was good at my job, I went above and beyond to please my guests, and I was compliant for the things the company wanted that did not improve performance and drained morale.


My fellow employees: even if you like it now, the time will come where you don't. If you're on the fence just apply at other places. If your worried about your staff feeling some kind of way about you leaving them, they can find something else too. An interview I had could not believe some of the things I was saying and it was like battered wife syndrome where I was like oh but there's this and that. None of it is good enough if you don't genuinely like coming in to work everyday. 


Gamestop: eff off. You'll find someone to replace my hours but they're just a body in the store and won't bring nearly as much compassion and loyalty as I did. I hope everyone else in my position follows along and my replacement is treated better, while gamestop corporate just sees what they can squeeze out of them. 

You've all got the retail experience, you've all got the customer service experience. The troubleshooting, management, descalating, coaching, problem solving, cash management, inventory control, shipping and receiving, payroll, and recruitment. These are all things that at another company would be assigned to a single person and we're expected to do all. You're better, you deserve better, you'll only find something better if you look. Much love, much respect and keep it real... customers still enjoy what you can do for them. But seriously, get the fudge out.. x

I was an AsL for the longest length of time mainly because I didn't have the confidence to take on Store Manager. I was also terrified of the responsibility of SM after seeing countless SM's come and go in my store, some(most) good, some bad. A little over 2 years ago now after holding the title of ""temp store manger"" for over 6 months due to the SM at the time going on medical leave and with a change in District Manager I was finally given the permanent store manager position and through that district manager built up a strong bond with them and quite frankly helped me overcome my insecurities as a leader and opened my eyes to my own self worth. I can not thank that dm enough in that regard and I really wanted to get that bit out of the way. Seriously,  thank you so so much.  

Jumping to today. The company climate and culture over the last few months has been one of the most alarming and mentally anguishing processes I've experienced as a ""veteran"" gamestop employee and going by how the reddit has been,  im not alone in feeling that way. It's not hyperbole and it's not just ""disgruntled employees on reddit."" It is a larger issue and corporate is either ignorant or more likely ignoring how dissatisfied literally every one in the field is.  It's likely a bit of both but I think the most evident way to see it is how they, with out even considering how, optically speaking, terrible that ""looking forward to fiscal 2023"" video was. When out of the gate, bolded and unabashedly saying ""our number one priority for fiscal 23 is profit"" it speaks volumes to how A) desperate things are and B) how blind they are to the shitty decisions they make. Its so short sighted to do the stuff they've done(payroll cuts, overtime cuts, tech support lay offs, etc) and they can't see how toxic and outright abusive these decisions have made the company's culture/work environment. It leads immediately to talent bleed which fine, thats what they want I guess, but it leads to GOOD talent bleeding out and leaving nothing but not so good/burnt out talent which is inevitably going to far worse performance at the store level, which in turn makes that number one priority impossible to achieve. Essentially setting everyone up in the field to fail. It's flabbergasting.

  I mean to put it bluntly, I ended q4 and the year with 4 out of 6 wins and because my two misses were warranty(by 6 percent) and hw attach(by .14 percent), the two most profitable metrics according to the RL I received back to back to back store performance write ups. In ten years I've never had write ups for performance and in the span of December received 2 and another in February has just broken the straw on the camels back. I just can't any more, my mental health has degraded so much,  it's effected me and my personal relationships,  I walk with the constant notion that I have failed as a store manager and am not ""talented"" enough to tough it out. And I know thats not true and it's outlandish to feel that way but I can't shake the feeling so I've made the decision to cut ties with gamestop. I WILL be better off and its so hard to move on but I know I have to, so I am.

 To end it with a single sentence to express my sentiment, essentially TLDR, I absolutely love working AT Gamestop, but I can no longer work FOR Gamestop.",1677953150.0

edit to update and clear some stuff up; 
also sorry guys I am on mobile! I realized that when I commented saying that I said ‚Äúokay i guess‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really add any context. my SL had asked me a week prior and i had said no then but was willing to add an extra 2 hours to help out at least and explained that to them over the phone. the night before is when they said I was scheduled to do the whole thing the next day and they told me they clearly remember me saying yes and I responded with the ‚ÄúI was not aware of that but okay I guess.‚Äù if that still implies that I accepted it though I accept that accountability and realize I should just be more assertive and clear from now on. 
after reading through a lot of the comments and seeing varying opinions or ideas I took all of them and decided to just call my SL and let them know what I was thinking and throw a lot of all of the points made here out, and that I was a bit peeved by the situation. they apologized and said that we must have gotten confused somewhere and got our days mixed up because they had me scheduled extra hours next week when I was supposed to do full coverage. so basically just a complete misunderstanding from both of our ends and i told them that reddit decided for us that text will be better from now on to avoid this happening again haha.  i opened and my SL came and closed so we ended up splitting the day just in reverse of what it was originally intended to be. at the end of the day i am still going to be looking for something better but just wanted to let everyone know it wasn‚Äôt a fiery ending! thank you to everyone who commented :).",1677854586.0

DO NOT stay silent on this. If this applies to you, contact your DL, RL, and HR for the backpay that is owed to you. 

Current info says that they weren‚Äôt paying those missing 8 weeks out yet because the SSC doesn‚Äôt trust the data is correct, then they paid the Q3 bonus with that same data factored in. And now the rumor mill is it‚Äôs not going to be paid out at all.

PRE-OWNED BOUNTY

Thank you for your support on our Pre-owned Bounty Program. Originally planned for just a few weeks the success of this program this led to meaningful improvement in Pre-owned performance over the summer months. PO Bounty also provided an opportunity for our Store Leaders to earn additional compensation. We will be sunsetting this program this week, at the end of Q3. We will continue to explore new ways to engage and incentivize our SLs and their teams in the future.
